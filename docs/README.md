# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Docs repository. This README serves as your central entry point for understanding and navigating all project management processes, workflows, and best practices used across OctoAcme projects.

## OctoAcme Project Management Overview

OctoAcme's project management approach is grounded in clear ownership, iterative delivery, and a culture of continuous improvement. At its foundation are well-defined roles, including the Project Manager (PM) who coordinates delivery, schedules, and risk management; the Product Manager (PdM) who owns product vision and backlog prioritization; Developers responsible for implementation and quality; dedicated QA/Testing personnel; and stakeholders who provide input and approvals. This strong persona framework supports effective role clarity and accountability throughout each phase of a project.

Projects at OctoAcme follow a consistent lifecycle: initiation, planning, execution, release, and retrospective. During the initiation stage, teams define project goals, identify stakeholders, and capture success metrics using concise one-pagers. Planning emphasizes breaking work into shippable increments, aligning milestones, and identifying dependencies. Execution is managed through daily standups, weekly syncs, and structured workflows using project boards. Core artifacts—such as backlog items with acceptance criteria, risk registers, and checklists—ensure every team member has access to clear, actionable information and can trace decision rationale.

Communication is a central pillar of OctoAcme's processes. Weekly sync meetings, twice-weekly standups, and monthly stakeholder updates keep everyone aligned and issues visible. The use of single sources of truth (such as project READMEs or release documents) and templates for regular and incident-based communications ensure updates are transparent and repeatable. Escalation paths and frequent reviews foster quick adaptation to risk or change.

Quality assurance is rigorously embedded in OctoAcme's workflows. The team adopts a layered testing strategy—unit, integration, end-to-end, and security checks—within a continuous integration pipeline. Branching, testing, and review standards are codified and reinforced with checklists for each phase from planning to release. Retrospectives and action item tracking ensure teams learn from each iteration and apply improvements, maintaining a high standard of delivery and team effectiveness across projects.
